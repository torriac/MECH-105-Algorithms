%This is an incomplete code used to solve for the lower and upper matrices and the pivot matrix of a given nxn matrix named "A".
%LU and P matrices have many uses when dealing with and analyzing systems of equations, so this code attempts to make finding
%those matrices very quick.

%Interactions between objects or fluids or anything can be analyzed with LU Decomposition if the A matrix is set up.
%A real life example of an A matrix for this function would be air flow in and out of connected rooms. This airflow creates a system
%that could be plugged into this function to get the tools to analyze the relationship between each room. 

function [L, U, P] = luFactor(A)
% luFactor(A)
%	LU decomposition with pivotiing
% inputs:
%	A = coefficient matrix
% outputs:
%	L = lower triangular matrix
%	U = upper triangular matrix
% P = the permutation matrix'
